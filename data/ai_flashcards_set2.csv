question,answer
"Machine Learning (ML)","A subset of AI that uses data to train algorithms to make predictions or decisions. It identifies patterns in past data to predict unknown outcomes."
"Inferencing","The application phase of a trained AI model where it classifies, predicts, generates, or decides actions based on new input data."
"Supervised Learning","A type of ML where algorithms are trained with labeled data, used for prediction and classification tasks."
"Unsupervised Learning","A type of ML where algorithms learn from unlabeled data, discovering patterns, clusters, or associations without predefined labels."
"Regression","A supervised ML technique that predicts continuous numeric values based on historical data."
"Classification","A supervised ML model that predicts categories or classes based on labeled data."
"Clustering","An unsupervised ML method that groups data points into clusters based on similarities, without using labels."
"k-Means, what does it mean when we say k = 4","How many of the clusters are representative of the data"
"Deep Learning (DL)","An advanced form of ML using deep neural networks with multiple layers to process complex data and identify patterns."
"Neural Networks (NNs)","Computational models inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers to process information."
"Weights in Neural Networks","Numerical values assigned to connections between neurons that adjust during training to optimize the network’s output."
"Forward Propagation","The process of passing input data through a neural network layer by layer to produce an output."
"Backward Propagation (Backpropagation)","A training process where errors are propagated back through the network to update weights and minimize loss."
"Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)","The simplest type of NN where connections do not form cycles, mainly used for regression and classification."
"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)","Specialized neural networks designed for image and video processing using convolutional layers to detect features."
"Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)","Neural networks designed for sequential data, such as time series or natural language, with connections that form cycles."
"Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)","Neural networks with a generator and discriminator that compete to produce realistic synthetic data."
"Prompt Engineering","The practice of designing and refining input intructions to generate specific, high-quality, useful responses from AI models."
"Open-Ended Prompts","Prompts designed to encourage extensive, thoughtful responses rather than closed, specific answers."
"Chain-of-Thought Prompting","A prompt engineering technique that breaks complex problems into smaller logical steps to improve reasoning."
"Few-Shot Learning","A prompt technique where a few examples are provided to guide the AI model’s response format and accuracy."
"Zero-Shot Learning","A prompting technique where the AI is asked to perform a task without being given prior examples, relying only on pre-trained knowledge."
"Self-Refine Prompting","A prompting technique where the model critiques and improves its own responses iteratively until satisfactory results are achieved."
"Transformer Architecture","A deep learning model architecture introduced in 'Attention Is All You Need' (2017), using self-attention, encoder-decoder structures, multihead encoding and positional encoding."
"Bias in Prompt Engineering","A challenge where AI outputs may reflect biases present in training data; mitigated through careful prompt design."
"Confusion Matrix","A table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model by comparing predicted labels with actual results. It shows counts of True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, and False Negatives."
"True Positive (TP)","When the model correctly predicts the positive class (e.g., predicting 'disease' when the patient actually has the disease)."
"True Negative (TN)","When the model correctly predicts the negative class (e.g., predicting 'no disease' when the patient is healthy)."
"False Positive (FP)","When the model incorrectly predicts the positive class (e.g., predicting 'disease' when the patient is actually healthy). Also called a Type I error."
"False Negative (FN)","When the model incorrectly predicts the negative class (e.g., predicting 'no disease' when the patient actually has the disease). Also called a Type II error."
